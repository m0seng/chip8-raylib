# TODO

- [ ] add sound support
- [ ] command line argument for ROM filename
- [ ] try to use less preprocessor actually! so that emulator can be configurable at runtime
    - [ ] similarly, move more things into the chip8 struct if it makes sense.
- [ ] super chip support
    - [ ] as we move towards larger display buffers and RAM sizes, I think we must malloc and free.
- [ ] xo chip support
